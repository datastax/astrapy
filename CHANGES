Deprecation of collection delete_all method in favour of delete_many(filter={})
    Introduction of a custom deprecation decorator for async method removal tests
Remove several long-deprecated methods from **core API** (i.e. internal changes):
    AstraDBCollection.delete          => delete_one
    AstraDBCollection.upsert          => upsert_one
    AsyncAstraDBCollection.upsert     => upsert_one
    AstraDB.truncate_collection       => AstraDBCollection.clear
    AsyncAstraDB.truncate_collection  => AsyncAstraDBCollectionclear


v. 1.2.1
========
Raise default chunk size for insert_many to 50
Improvements in docstrings, testing, support for latest responses from vectorize.


v. 1.2.0
========
Non-Astra environment awareness:
    astrapy.constants.Environment enum for the "environment" parameter to client, etc
    flexibility and adaptive defaults for data api url
    environment knowledge trickles throughout all classes (client, admins, databases)
    DataAPIDatabaseAdmin class (i.e. for namespace CRUD)
(internal) astrapy.api_commander.APICommander
(internal) astrapy.api_options.{BaseAPIOptions, CollectionAPIOptions}
$vectorize support:
    "service options" for creating/retrieving collections, covering $vectorize needs
    embedding_api_key parameter to collection (for "header" usage)
collection-level timeout parameter (overridable in single method calls)
expand "projection" type to include slice projections
client.get_database can accept an API endpoint directly
insert_many and bulk_write default to ordered=False


v. 1.1.0
========
Adds estimated_document_count method to Collection class.

================
What is now dubbed the "core API" and is not supposed to be used directly at all.
