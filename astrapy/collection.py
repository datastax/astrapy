class Collection:
    """
    A Data API collection, the main object to interact with the Data API,
    especially for DDL operations.
    This class has a synchronous interface.

    A Collection is spawned from a Database object, from which it inherits
    the details on how to reach the API server (endpoint, authentication token).

    Args:
        database: a Database object, instantiated earlier. This represents
            the database the collection belongs to.
        name: the collection name. This parameter should match an existing
            collection on the database.
        namespace: this is the namespace to which the collection belongs.
            This is generally not specified, in which case the general setting
            for the provided Database is used.
        caller_name: name of the application, or framework, on behalf of which
            the Data API calls are performed. This ends up in the request user-agent.
        caller_version: version of the caller.

    Note:
        creating an instance of Collection does not trigger actual creation
        of the collection on the database. The latter should have been created
        beforehand, e.g. through the `create_collection` method of a Database.

            the insertion proceeds until exhausting the input documents: then,

            written to the database, including those "after" the troublesome ones.

        Find documents on the collection, matching a certain provided filter.

        collection mutations occurred since the `find` method was called, or not.
        In cases where the cursor reflects mutations in real-time, it will iterate

        or duplicate documents). This happens when making use of the `sort`
        option in a non-vector-search manner.

        Args:
            filter: a predicate expressed as a dictionary according to the
                Data API filter syntax. Examples are:

                See the Data API documentation for the full set of operators.
            projection: used to select a subset of fields in the documents being
                returned. The projection can be: an iterable over the field names
                to return; a dictionary {field_name: True} to positively select
                certain fields; or a dictionary {field_name: False} if one wants
                to discard some fields from the response.
                The default is to return the whole documents.
            skip: with this integer parameter, what would be the first `skip`
                documents returned by the query are discarded, and the results
                start from the (skip+1)-th document.
            limit: this (integer) parameter sets a limit over how many documents
                are returned. Once `limit` is reached (or the cursor is exhausted
                for lack of matching documents), nothing more is returned.
            sort: with this dictionary parameter one can control the order
                the documents are returned. See the Note about sorting for details.

        Returns:
            a Cursor object representing iterations over the matching documents
            (see the Cursor object for how to use it. The simplest thing is to
            run a for loop: `for document in collection.sort(...):`).

            The following are example values for the `sort` parameter.

            (while modern Python versions preserve the order of dictionaries,
            it is suggested for clarity to employ a `collections.OrderedDict`

            of documents it will count, and that an exception will be thrown
            by this method if this limit is encountered.

                The default is to return the whole documents.

                documents returned by the query are discarded, and the results

                are returned. Once `limit` is reached (or the cursor is exhausted
                for lack of matching documents), nothing more is returned.

            Count operations are expensive: for this reason, the best practice
            is to provide a reasonable `upper_bound` according to the caller
            expectations. Moreover, indiscriminate usage of count operations
            for sizeable amounts of documents (i.e. in the thousands and more)
            is discouraged in favor of alternative application-specific solutions.
            Keep in mind that the Data API has a hard upper limit on the amount
            of documents it will count, and that an exception will be thrown
            by this method if this limit is encountered.
