class TimeoutOptions:
    """
    The group of settings for the API Options concerning the configured timeouts
    for various kinds of API operations.

    All timeout values are integers expressed
    in milliseconds. A timeout of zero signifies that no timeout is imposed at all
    on that kind of operation.

    All methods that issue HTTP requests allow for a per-invocation override
    of the relevant timeouts involved (see the method docstring and signature
    for details).

    This class is used to override default settings when creating objects such
    as DataAPIClient, Database, Table, Collection and so on. Values that are left
    unspecified will keep the values inherited from the parent "spawner" class.
    See the `APIOptions` master object for more information and usage examples.

    Attributes:
        request_timeout_ms: the timeout imposed on a single HTTP request.
            This is applied to all HTTP requests to both the Data API and the DevOps
            API, with the specific exception of the one request issued by the
            Database's create_collection method (which despite being a single request
            may take a considerable amount of time to complete). Defaults to 10 s.
        general_method_timeout_ms: a timeout to use on the overall duration of a
            method invocation, valid for DML methods which are not concerned with
            schema or admin operations. For some methods (such as `find_one` for
            the Table or Collection classes), this coincides with `request_timeout_ms`:
            in that case, the minimum value of the two is used to limit the request
            duration. For other methods, which possibly comprise several HTTP requests
            (for example `insert_many`), this timeout limits the overall duration time
            of the method invocation, while the per-request timeout is still determined
            by `request_timeout_ms`, separately. Defaults to 30 s.
        collection_admin_timeout_ms: a timeout for all collection-related schema and
            admin operations: creating/dropping a collection, as well as listing them.
            With the exception of collection creation, each individual request issued as
            part of collection-schema operations still must obey `request_timeout_ms`.
            Defaults to 60 s.
        table_admin_timeout_ms: a timeout for all table-related schema and
            admin operations: creating/altering/dropping a table or a table index,
            as well as listing tables/indexes. Each individual request issued as part
            of table-schema operations still must obey `request_timeout_ms`.
            Defaults to 30 s.
        database_admin_timeout_ms: a timeout for all database-related admin operations.
            Creating/dropping a database, listing databases, getting database info,
            querying for the available embedding providers, are all subject
            to this timeout. The longest-running operations in this class are
            the creation and the destruction of a database: if called with the
            `wait_until_complete=True` parameter, these can last several minutes.
            This is the timeout that control if and when the method invocation should
            ever error with an `astrapy.exceptions.DataAPITimeoutException`.
            Note that individual API request issued within those operation still must
            obey the per-request `request_timeout_ms` additional constraint.
            Defaults to 10 m.
        keyspace_admin_timeout_ms: a timeout for all keyspace-related admin operations.
            Creating, altering and dropping a keyspace, as well as listing keyspaces,
            are operations controlled by this timeout. Individual API request issued
            within those operation still must obey the per-request

@dataclass
class SerdesOptions:
    """
    The group of settings for the API Options concerning serialization and
    deserialization of values to and from the Data API. Write-path settings
    affect how values are encoded in the JSON payload to API requests, and
    read-path settings determine the choice of data types used to represent
    values found in the API responses when a method returns data.

    This class is used to override default settings when creating objects such
    as DataAPIClient, Database, Table, Collection and so on. Values that are left
    unspecified will keep the values inherited from the parent "spawner" class.
    See the `APIOptions` master object for more information and usage examples.

    Only the classes that directly exchange data with the API, i.e. Table and
    Collection, make actual use of the settings in this group. Nevertheless,
    all objects in the hierarchy (for example DataAPIClient) have their own
    customizable SerdesOptions settings: this makes it easy to configure one's
    preference once and just have each spawned Collection or Table inherit the
    desired settings.

    Attributes:
        binary_encode_vectors: Write-Path. Whether to encode vectors using the faster,
            more efficient binary encoding as opposed to sending plain lists
            of numbers. For Tables, this affects vectors passed to write methods
            as instances of `DataAPIVector`, while for collections this affects
            the encoding of the quantity found in the "$vector" field, if present,
            regardless of its representation in the method argument. Defaults to True.
            *Note: For release `2.0.0-preview`, binary encoding in collections is OFF.*
        custom_datatypes_in_reading: Read-Path. This setting determines whether return
            values from read methods should use astrapy custom classes (default setting
            of True), or try to use only standard-library data types instead (False).
            The astrapy classes are designed to losslessly express DB values.
            For Collections, this setting only affects timestamp and vector values,
            while when reading from a Table there are several other implications.
            Keep in mind that for some of the data types, choosing the stdlib fallback
            may lead to approximate results and even lead to errors (for instance if a
            date stored on database falls outside of the range the stdlib can express).
            Here is a list of the fallbacks (see the individual classes for more info):
            * DataAPIVector => list[float]: no loss of expressivity.
            * DataAPITimestamp  => datetime.datetime: shorter year range (1AD-9999AD)
            and lossy storage of sub-second part for ancient years.
            * DataAPIDate => datetime.date: same year range limitations.
            * DataAPITime => datetime.time: approximation (datetime.time
            has microsecond precision, so the nanosecond part, if present, is lost).
            * DataAPIDuration => datetime.timedelta: durations are intrinsically a
            different thing (see `DataAPIDuration` class). If requested, a coercion
            into a timedelta is attempted, but (a) months are not expressable, (b)
            days are always interpreted as made of 24 hours (despite the occasional
            23- or 25-hour day), and (c) nanoseconds are lost just like for DataAPITime.
            * DataAPIMap => dict: would raise an error if non-hashable data types (e.g.
            lists) are allowed as keys in map-columns on the Table.
            * DataAPISet => set: would raise an error if non-hashable data types (e.g.
            lists) are allowed as entries in set-columns on the Table.
        unroll_iterables_to_lists: Write-Path. If this is set to True, a wider group
            of data types can be provided where a list of values is expected: anything
            that can be iterated over is automatically "unrolled" into a list prior to
            insertion. This means, for example, that one can directly use classes such
            as numpy objects or generators for writes where a vector is expected.
            This setting defaults to False, as it incurs some performance cost (due
            to preemptive inspection of all values in dictionaries provided for writes).
        use_decimals_in_collections: both Read- and Write-path. The `decimal.Decimal`
            standard library class represents lossless numbers with exact arithmetic
            (as opposed to the standard Python floats which hold a finite number
            of significant digits, thus possibly with approximate arithmetic).
            This settings, relevant for Collections only, affects both paths:
            * for the Write-Path, if set to True, `Decimal` instances are accepted
            for storage into collections and are written losslessly. The default
            value of False means that `Decimal` numbers are not accepted for writes.
            * for the Read-Path, if this is set to True, then *all* numeric values
            found in documents from the collection (except the values in "$vector")
            are returned as `Decimal` instances. Conversely, with the default setting
            of `use_decimals_in_collections = False`, read documents are returned as
            containing only regular integers and floats.
            Before switching this setting to True, one should consider the actual need
            for lossless arbitrary decimal precision in their application: besides the
            fact that every number is then returned as an instance of `Decimal` when
            reading from collections, an additional performance cost is required to
            manage the serialization/deserialization of objects exchanged with the API.
        accept_naive_datetimes: Write-Path. Python datetimes can be either "naive" or
            "aware" of a timezone/offset information. Only the latter type can be
            translated unambiguously and without implied assumptions into a well-defined
            timestamp. Because the Data API always stores timestamps, by default astrapy
            will raise an error if a write is attempted that uses a naive datetime.
            If this setting is changed to True (from its default of False), then astrapy
            will stop complaining about naive datetimes and accept them as valid
            timestamps for writes. These will be converted into timestamps using
            their `.timestamp()` method, which uses the system locale implicitly.
            It is important to appreciate the possible consequences, for example
            if a table or collection is shared by instances of the application
            running with different system locales.
        datetime_tzinfo: Read-Path. When reading timestamps from tables or collection
            with the setting `custom_datatypes_in_reading = False`, ordinary
            `datetime.datetime` objects are returned for timestamps read from the
            database. This setting (defaulting to `datetime.timezone.utc`) determines
            the timezone used in the returned datetime objects. Setting this value
            to None results in naive datetimes being returned (not recommended).

            into a timedelta is attempted, but (a) months are not expressable, (b)
            days are always interpreted as made of 24 hours (despite the occasional
            23- or 25-hour day), and (c) nanoseconds are lost just like for DataAPITime.
            * DataAPIMap => dict: would raise an error if non-hashable data types (e.g.
            lists) are allowed as keys in map-columns on the Table.
            * DataAPISet => set: would raise an error if non-hashable data types (e.g.
            lists) are allowed as entries in set-columns on the Table.
        unroll_iterables_to_lists: Write-Path. If this is set to True, a wider group
            of data types can be provided where a list of values is expected: anything
            that can be iterated over is automatically "unrolled" into a list prior to
            insertion. This means, for example, that one can directly use classes such
            as numpy objects or generators for writes where a vector is expected.
            This setting defaults to False, as it incurs some performance cost (due
            to preemptive inspection of all values in dictionaries provided for writes).
        use_decimals_in_collections: both Read- and Write-path. The `decimal.Decimal`
            standard library class represents lossless numbers with exact arithmetic
            (as opposed to the standard Python floats which hold a finite number
            of significant digits, thus possibly with approximate arithmetic).
            This settings, relevant for Collections only, affects both paths:
            * for the Write-Path, if set to True, `Decimal` instances are accepted
            for storage into collections and are written losslessly. The default
            value of False means that `Decimal` numbers are not accepted for writes.
            * for the Read-Path, if this is set to True, then *all* numeric values
            found in documents from the collection (except the values in "$vector")
            are returned as `Decimal` instances. Conversely, with the default setting
            of `use_decimals_in_collections = False`, read documents are returned as
            containing only regular integers and floats.
            Before switching this setting to True, one should consider the actual need
            for lossless arbitrary decimal precision in their application: besides the
            fact that every number is then returned as an instance of `Decimal` when
            reading from collections, an additional performance cost is required to
            manage the serialization/deserialization of objects exchanged with the API.
        accept_naive_datetimes: Write-Path. Python datetimes can be either "naive" or
            "aware" of a timezone/offset information. Only the latter type can be
            translated unambiguously and without implied assumptions into a well-defined
            timestamp. Because the Data API always stores timestamps, by default astrapy
            will raise an error if a write is attempted that uses a naive datetime.
            If this setting is changed to True (from its default of False), then astrapy
            will stop complaining about naive datetimes and accept them as valid
            timestamps for writes. These will be converted into timestamps using
            their `.timestamp()` method, which uses the system locale implicitly.
            It is important to appreciate the possible consequences, for example
            if a table or collection is shared by instances of the application
            running with different system locales.
        datetime_tzinfo: Read-Path. When reading timestamps from tables or collection
            with the setting `custom_datatypes_in_reading = False`, ordinary
            `datetime.datetime` objects are returned for timestamps read from the
            database. This setting (defaulting to `datetime.timezone.utc`) determines
            the timezone used in the returned datetime objects. Setting this value
            to None results in naive datetimes being returned (not recommended).

@dataclass
class APIOptions:
    """
    This class represents all settings that can be configured for how astrapy
    interacts with the API (both Data API and DevOps API). Each object in the
    abstraction hierarchy (DataAPIClient, Database, Table, Collection, ...)
    has a full set of these options that determine how it behaves when performing
    actions toward the API.

    In order to customize the behavior from its preset defaults, one should create
    an `APIOptions` object and either:
    (a) pass it as the `api_options` argument to the DataAPIClient constructor or
    any of the `.with_options` and `.to_[a]sync` methods, to get a new instance of
    an object with some settings changed.
    (b) pass it as the `spawn_api_options` argument to "spawning methods", such as
    `get/create_collection`, `get/create_table`, `get/create_database` or
    `get_database_admin`, to set these option overrides to the returned object.
    The APIOptions object passed as argument can define zero, some or all of its
    members, overriding the corresponding settings and keeping, for all unspecified
    settings, the values inherited from the object whose method is invoked (see some
    examples below).
    Some of these methods admit a few shorthands for settings to be passed directly,
    such as `token="..."`, as an alternative to wrapping the setting into its own
    APIOptions object: this however, while taking precedence over the full object
    if provided at the same time, only covers the few most important settings one
    may want to customize when spawning objects.

    With the exception of the "database/admin additional headers" attributes and
    the "redacted header names", which are merged with the inherited ones,
    the override logic is the following: if an override is provided (even if it
    is None), it completely replaces the inherited value.

    The structure of APIOptions is one and the same throughout the object hierarchy:
    that makes it possible to set, for example, a serialization option for reading
    from Collections at the Database level, so that each Collection spawned from it
    will have the desired behavior; similarly, this makes it possible to set a
    DevOps-API-related option (such as `dev_ops_api_url_options.dev_ops_url`)
    for a Table, an action which has no effect whatsoever.

    Attributes:
        environment: an identifier for the environment for the Data API. This can
            describe an Astra DB environment (such as the default of "prod"), or
            a self-deployed setup (such as "dse" or "hcd"). This setting cannot be
            overridden through customization: it can only be provided when creating
            the DataAPIClient top object in the abstraction hierarchy.
        callers: an iterable of "caller identities" to be used in identifying the
            caller, through the User-Agent header, when issuing requests to the
            Data API. Each caller identity is a `(name, version)` 2-item tuple whose
            elements can be strings or None.
        database_additional_headers: free-form dictionary of additional headers to
            employ when issuing requests to the Data API from Database, Table and
            Collection classes. Passing a key with a value of None means that a certain
            header is suppressed when issuing the request.
        admin_additional_headers: free-form dictionary of additional headers to
            employ when issuing requests to both the Data API and the DevOps API
            from AstraDBAdmin, AstraDBDatabaseAdmin and DataAPIDatabaseAdmin classes.
            Passing a key with a value of None means that a certain header is
            suppressed when issuing the request.
        redacted_header_names: A set of (case-insensitive) strings denoting the headers
            that contain secrets, thus are to be masked when logging request details.
        token: an instance of TokenProvider to provide authentication to requests.
            Passing a string, or None, to this constructor parameter will get it
            automatically converted into the appropriate TokenProvider object.
            Depending on the target (Data API or DevOps API), this one attribute
            is encoded in the request appropriately.
        embedding_api_key: an instance of EmbeddingHeadersProvider should it be needed
            for vectorize-related data operations (used by Tables and Collections).
            Passing a string, or None, to this constructor parameter will get it
            automatically converted into the appropriate EmbeddingHeadersProvider
            object.
        timeout_options: an instance of `TimeoutOptions` (see) to control the timeout
            behavior for the various kinds of operations involving the Data/DevOps API.
        serdes_options: an instance of `SerdesOptions` (see) to customize the
            serializing/deserializing behavior related to writing to and reading from
            tables and collections.
        data_api_url_options: an instance of `DataAPIURLOptions` (see) to customize
            the full URL used to reach the Data API (customizing this setting
            is rarely needed).
        dev_ops_api_url_options: an instance of `DevOpsAPIURLOptions` (see) to
            customize the URL used to reach the DevOps API (customizing this setting
            is rarely needed; relevant only for Astra DB environments).

@dataclass
class FullAPIOptions(APIOptions):
    """
    This class represents all settings that can be configured for how astrapy
    interacts with the API (both Data API and DevOps API). Each object in the
    abstraction hierarchy (DataAPIClient, Database, Table, Collection, ...)
    has a full set of these options that determine how it behaves when performing
    actions toward the API.

    This is the "full" version of the class, with the guarantee that all of its members
    have defined values. As such, this is what classes such as DataAPIClient, Database,
    Table, Collection and so on have as their `.api_options` attribute -- as opposed
    to the (non-full) `APIOptions` counterpart class: the latter admits "unset"
    attributes and is used to override specific settings. Please refer to the
    documentation for the `APIOptions` class for more details on how to customize
    the objects' behavior.

    Attributes:
        environment: an identifier for the environment for the Data API. This can
            describe an Astra DB environment (such as the default of "prod"), or
            a self-deployed setup (such as "dse" or "hcd"). This setting cannot be
            overridden through customization: it can only be provided when creating
            the DataAPIClient top object in the abstraction hierarchy.
        callers: an iterable of "caller identities" to be used in identifying the
            caller, through the User-Agent header, when issuing requests to the
            Data API. Each caller identity is a `(name, version)` 2-item tuple whose
            elements can be strings or None.
        database_additional_headers: free-form dictionary of additional headers to
            employ when issuing requests to the Data API from Database, Table and
            Collection classes. Passing a key with a value of None means that a certain
            header is suppressed when issuing the request.
        admin_additional_headers: free-form dictionary of additional headers to
            employ when issuing requests to both the Data API and the DevOps API
            from AstraDBAdmin, AstraDBDatabaseAdmin and DataAPIDatabaseAdmin classes.
            Passing a key with a value of None means that a certain header is
            suppressed when issuing the request.
        redacted_header_names: A set of (case-insensitive) strings denoting the headers
            that contain secrets, thus are to be masked when logging request details.
        token: an instance of TokenProvider to provide authentication to requests.
            Passing a string, or None, to this constructor parameter will get it
            automatically converted into the appropriate TokenProvider object.
            Depending on the target (Data API or DevOps API), this one attribute
            is encoded in the request appropriately.
        embedding_api_key: an instance of EmbeddingHeadersProvider should it be needed
            for vectorize-related data operations (used by Tables and Collections).
            Passing a string, or None, to this constructor parameter will get it
            automatically converted into the appropriate EmbeddingHeadersProvider
            object.
        timeout_options: an instance of `TimeoutOptions` (see) to control the timeout
            behavior for the various kinds of operations involving the Data/DevOps API.
        serdes_options: an instance of `SerdesOptions` (see) to customize the
            serializing/deserializing behavior related to writing to and reading from
            tables and collections.
        data_api_url_options: an instance of `DataAPIURLOptions` (see) to customize
            the full URL used to reach the Data API (customizing this setting
            is rarely needed).
        dev_ops_api_url_options: an instance of `DevOpsAPIURLOptions` (see) to
            customize the URL used to reach the DevOps API (customizing this setting
            is rarely needed; relevant only for Astra DB environments).
