class DatabaseInfo:
    """
    Represents the identifying information for a database,
    including the region the connection is established to.

    Attributes:
        id: the database ID.
        region: the ID of the region through which the connection to DB is done.
        namespace: the namespace this DB is set to work with.
        name: the database name. Not necessarily unique: there can be multiple
            databases with the same name.
        environment: a label, whose value is one of Environment.PROD, Environment.DEV
            or Environment.TEST.
        raw_info: the full response from the DevOPS API call to get this info.

    Note:
        The `raw_info` dictionary usually has a `region` key describing
        the default region as configured in the database, which does not
        necessarily (for multi-region databases) match the region through
        which the connection is established: the latter is the one specified
        by the "api endpoint" used for connecting. In other words, for multi-region
        databases it is possible that
            database_info.region != database_info.raw_info["region"]
        Conversely, in case of a DatabaseInfo not obtained through a
        connected database, such as when calling `Admin.list_databases()`,
        all fields except `environment` (e.g. namespace, region, etc)
        are set as found on the DevOps API response directly.
